# Two Truths and a Lie – JavaScript Game  

This project is a simple **interactive web game** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The game allows two players to participate: Player 1 enters claims, and Player 2 guesses which one is a lie.

## 📂 Files  

- `index.html` → Main HTML file containing the game layout  
- `script.js` → JavaScript file that handles game logic  
- Embedded CSS → Basic styling included in `<style>` tags  

---

## 📝 Game Features  

### Player 1
- Enter three claims in text inputs  
- Select which claims are true or false using radio buttons  
- Save the claims for Player 2 to guess  

### Player 2
- View the claims entered by Player 1  
- Guess which claim is the lie  
- Reveal the result to see if the guess was correct  

### JavaScript Concepts Practiced
- Event handling (`click` events for buttons)  
- DOM manipulation (`document.getElementById`, `classList`)  
- Conditional logic to determine correct guesses  
- Form handling and input validation  

### HTML & CSS Concepts
- Forms and inputs (`<form>`, `<input type="text">`, `<input type="radio">`)  
- Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`)  
- Basic styling with classes and inline CSS  
- Showing and hiding elements dynamically (`.hidden` class)

## 🚀 How to Use  

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  

2. Player 1 fills in the three claims and selects which are true/false.  

3. Click **Save Claims** to pass the claims to Player 2. 

4. Player 2 makes a guess and clicks **Reveal Result** to see the outcome.  

5. Inspect or modify `script.js` to change game logic or styling.

## 📌 Notes  

- This is a simple learning exercise to practice **HTML forms, CSS styling, and JavaScript DOM manipulation**.  
- The game demonstrates **two-player interaction** using dynamic content updates.  
- All logic is handled client-side using JavaScript; no backend is required.
